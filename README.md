# JSxec

A Javascript injector for modern browsers.

This was my attempt to learn how extensions work and to learn how new CTF challenges can be made from this and to analyze the impact of extensions on web security and to further improve my knowledge in JS.

Written in manifest version 2, sadly they are dropping arbitary script execution through the chrome.tabs api, and unsafe eval csp blocks inline js :(, Until i find a workaround this project will stay in manifest version 2.
